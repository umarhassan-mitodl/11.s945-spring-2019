## Case Study Analysis and Presentation (due weeks 6–8)

Students will work in small groups (4–6 people) to present a 15–20 minute case study and lead discussion on a current set of urban problematics related to equity and inclusion. A primary goal of the case study is to provide students with a chance to hone their professional research and presentation skills. Groups for the case study presentations should be set by the third week of class, with additional details on the presentation content expectations also provided by the Instructor at that time. Suggested case topics and articles will be added to the syllabus by the teams and distributed to the class in advance of their presentations.

## Final Paper (due Tuesday of week 13)

Students may write either a professional memo-style policy brief or a traditional, 12–15 page academic-style paper, depending on their interest. This paper must relate to some aspect of the case study they have presented. Students are encouraged to use the final paper as an opportunity to flesh out their thinking as pertains to other academic interests and deliverables (thesis proposal, past or upcoming research projects, etc.). These are individual papers, not group assignments. Students working on the same group case are expected to write their own paper or brief, focusing on an aspect or theme in the case that is of interest to them.
